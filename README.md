Salon Appointment Scheduler
Overview
The Salon Appointment Scheduler is a bash-based system that allows salon customers to book appointments for various services. The project utilizes PostgreSQL as the database system, stores information about customers, services, and appointments, and provides a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system.

This project implements user stories such as creating customers, scheduling appointments, and displaying services offered by the salon. The purpose of the project is to manage the scheduling process in a smooth and organized manner.

How to Run

bash
Copy code
./salon.sh
The script will:

Display a list of available services.
Prompt the user to select a service by entering the service ID.
Ask for the customer's phone number to identify the customer.
If the phone number doesn't exist, it will prompt for the customer's name and add them to the system.
Ask for the desired time for the appointment.
Confirm the booking by outputting the service and time.
